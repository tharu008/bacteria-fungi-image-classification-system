                    <p className='flex py-4'>PPM™, short for Plant Preservative Mixture™, is a heat-stable preservative and biocide specifically formulated to effectively prevent or minimize microbial contamination in plant tissue culture. When used at optimal doses, PPM™ demonstrates exceptional efficacy in preserving cultures without hindering in vitro seed germination, callus proliferation, or regeneration. It acts by preventing the germination of both bacteria and fungi spores and can withstand autoclaving with the culture media due to its heat stability. PPM™ is recommended as a standard component in plant tissue culture media, offering a cost-effective alternative to commonly used antibiotics. Its primary purpose is to inhibit contamination from airborne, waterborne, and human-induced sources, and in some cases, it can also help reduce endogenous contamination.</p>
